# Handy Note Taker

## Description
A Node application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

For this project i was provided client-side html, css and javascript files, and was tasked with creating a node server and routes, using express framework, and handling the post and get requests using the fs module. I also implemented async await fuctions and promises for all helper functions that connected the db and routes to the front-end. 

### User Story

> As a **user**, I want to **be able to write and save notes** and I WANT **to be able to delete notes I've written before** so that **I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete**.
